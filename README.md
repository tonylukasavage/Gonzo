## Overview
Gonzo is lightweight desktop markdown editor built using Adobe Air, AS3, and Flex 4.5.  The aim to is to have a very simple editor that gives you the ability to write markdown while viewing a live HTML preview.  When you're done, you can export the generated HTML and add the content directly to your blog or other web publishing target.

## Development
The source for this project is a Flash Builder project based on Flex 4.5.  I have not attempted to load into any other IDE or Flex SDK.  

The goal is to make this is a robust desktop application, so I will _not_ be attempting to make this usable for mobile or web.  That's not to say there won't be spin offs for web or mobile, but at this point, its not on the roadmap. 


## Todo
